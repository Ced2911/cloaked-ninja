The file 'PSEmu_Plugin_Defs.h' is released to the public domain, contrary
to its headers. This is an excerpt from a forum, by Pete Bernert (who wrote
many of the plugins and was a PCSX contributor):

"The "PSEmu Plugin Def.h" header file is very old (1998) and (as you
have noticed) contains just a few basic defines. When PSemu Pro died in
early 1999, and new psx emus showed up, the Vision Thing crew allowed
free usage/enhancements of the interface. Sure, nobody ever updated the
header file to state something new, but Duddie gave his agreement, as
well as Kazz with his XA audio defines (used in the spu plugin
interface). So, there is nothing to worry about using the headers."
