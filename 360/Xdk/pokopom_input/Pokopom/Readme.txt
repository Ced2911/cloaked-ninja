Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pokopom is a PSEmu Pro pad plugin that emulates a DualShock1 and DualShock2 
controller for PS1 and PS2 emulators respectively. It only uses XInput, so as 
to avoid the DirectInput troubles with X360 controllers.

It currently has only some basic configuration dialog, and defaults to use 
the first and second XInput controllers as pad1 and pad2 respectively. 

The plugin supports rumble with a nice custom curve, and has extended analog 
stick range to cover the 'square' on PSX's controllers.

To toggle between analog or digital mode, press the Scroll Lock key.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An emulator that supports PSEmu Pro input plugins, and a computer that can run
it. Also, since it uses XInput only it requires a controller such as X360 ones,
or any controller if you use X360ce to get XInput support.

It might also require C++ VS2010 runtimes too...
